# Chapter 2. Basic Kotlin

At this chapter I have learned more about arrays.
The work with arrays is pretty similar how you work with java arrays
Also in this chapter I have learned about random numbers. 
The random numbers usage is widely spread in cryptography

The last but not least - you can convert data types to desired data types
just by calling method of object instance
